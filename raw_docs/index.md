- voltage sag
    - make a chart of voltage vs current behavior for a few different internal resistances
- show how the cell resistances add up in series and parallel
- find modeling of speed and power and document
    - 2018 notebooks in `electric-bicycle/analysis`
- add field weakening notes
- flesh out performance questions
- speed air power stuff
- add examples of computations with code behind them
    - no-load speed
- add motor sheets from jupyter notebooks
